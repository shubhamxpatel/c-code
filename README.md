# c-code

In this programme you have to enter polynomials in coefficient form 
for eg 
p1=2x^2+x+1
p2=x^3+1
then first enter two numbers m,n
where m=degree(p1)+1
n=degree(p2)+1
and then enter m numbers like for p1
1 1 2
and for p2
1 0 0 1

and after entering all data you will get your result like

2x^(5)+1x^(4)+1x^(3)+2x^(2)+1x^(1)+1x^(0)
